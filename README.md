# Convolutional Neural Network

Classification of RGB images using convolutional neural network architecture.

#### Conv2D -> RELU -> MaxPOOL -> Conv2D -> RELU -> MaxPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FUllYCONNECTED

###### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/multi-label-classification-models/data
  * Target column/label: 10 different products name
###### FrameworK: Tensorflow (Estimator)
###### IDE: Google Colab
###### Dataset Storage:
save dataset(images) into google drive in zip. Read images from there (Details in code). styles.csv is uploaded from local storage but can be easily read from the drive like images.
